# HangmanGamePy
A simple working Hangman game that uses around 1000 words to choose from as a guessing word. Currently works in terminal, but may be built upon into a game app with pygame. Tis hangman game will keep going until you guess correctly Don't worry if you keep mistaking any letters, it won't hurt your score This runs perfectly great in the python console.
